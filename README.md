# focusstim_TMS
Analysis scripts and data for focusttim_TMS, a cognitive neuroscience study in which we used rTMS to probe the causal role of the posterior IFG (pIFG) for syntactic processing and the anterior IFG (aIFG) for semantic processing in a task that required the interpretation of the sentenceâ€™s prosodic realisation.
